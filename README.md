# Welcome to my personal website johced.com 

## This was my first own creation from Figma mockup to live site
This site will never truly be finished, and I have a few ideas on what comes next. As of now it is more like a business card, It will evole into my portfolio page. 

## Whats here? 
- linear-gradient on background. 
- custom cursor 
- count-down to graduation
- scss
- mouse-over contact btn - changes color on social icons aswell as it's own hover effect

## Whats to come? 
- Some kind for animation on my "skillset part"
- Portfolio 
- Redo the color palette to be more light again 
- Form for contact (maybe) 
- Redo the footer with svg instead of my funny temporary solution with border-radius
